       "      <th>I started having trouble turning my key to start the jeep, then it wouldn't turn all the way back to the lock position..so I took the steering wheel off to access the switch and stuff. I found a spring had worked it's way into the gears on the switch assembly. Does anyone know what those springs are for? Now I'm trying to put it back together minus the springs, but am having trouble figuring out where some rod goes. I think it's the high/low beam actuater rod, but it feels really loose..so I'm thinking it may have became disconnected at the other end. Anyone had the steering column apart..any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm almost ready to take it to the dealer and let them put the pieces back together. Thanks, Charlie</th>\n",

       "      <th>Let me start off by saying I have never owned Jeep and know very little about them or any solid axle truck for that matter. I am looking at getting a modified used '95 YJ and I'm looking for your advice and opinions, potential problems I might encounter. This would be a third vehicle for us which would only be used for offroading. Here is the Jeep in particular I am looking at : http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/exterior.jpg http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/Front.jpg http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/suspension.jpg http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/discos or not.jpg The dealer doesn't know too much about it, He said it has a 5\" susp. lift, 1\" body lift (the blocks looked like a 2\" to me), automatic locker in the rear (doesn't know what brand), 488 gears, 35\" Mickey Thompson Baja Claws on Cobra Mustang wheels , and custom front and rear bumpers with integrated hitch (don't know what brand). Its a 4 banger BTW. I test drove it briefly, and with the wheel at full turn the tires rub a lot, not sure on what though; bumper or fender well. Does this mean that on full compression they would also have major rubbing? I have no way of testing that out. One more thing, I have never driven a truck that had Death Wobble but I'm pretty sure this one did, around 35-40. The dealer said the toe in was screwed up and they would fix it, but it concerns me. Also I noticed no steering stabilizer, which I'm sure would help a bit. Anyway, I would plan on having a mechanic look at it, checking the ball joints and so on. It seems like a nicely built truck for a really good price, but I'm nervous. I couldn't afford to build my own for this amount, thats for sure. I'm not about to go out and buy it without researching it though, so any advice you can give would be great. Also, from what you know and the pictures I have what price range would you give it (107K miles). If anyone lives in the twin cities area that feels like helping a jeep rookie out, that would be awesome too. I get the feeling that I should probably wait it out and get something I know a little more about though.</th>\n",

Its a 4 speed auto and its accually pretty strong. I have heard of people converting to that tranny. its allot better. has a locking torch converter on it that is acccually programable. so you can set it to lock up for the most part. what that means is the auto tranny won't disengadge going down hills as much. It will stay in gear. allot better gear ratio in the tranny for both on and off road performance. I really wanted to put one in my jeep but the convertion for ford to gm tanny was more then i wanted to spend at the time, Still planning on it though. You will want to change out at least your back axle. cuz your going to break it with a v8. i broke mine liek 2 times. Changed over to a ford 8.8 axle off of a ford explorer. the best year of axle is 95 and newer. They come with disc brakes. the 8.8 is allot stronger then the dana 44 axles. You can go to http://mountainoffroad.com and they have some info on the convertion and a kit for it to. as far as radiator goes the stock yj radiator will work fine. but if you want a really good radiator you can go to http://zandm.com and they have a really good radiator there and some other jeep parts that they make. for the exhaust i would just go with shorty headers and then have a muffler shop run the exhaust out the sides under the frame right behind or in frount of where the leaf springs connect to the frame. they fix there pretty well and then run glass packs down the side and out in frount of the back tires. Thats how i have them on my jeep i will get some pics and post them on my jeep page if you want. just email me if you have any other questions.</th>\n",

I am looking at getting a modified used '95 YJ and I'm looking for your advice and opinions, potential problems I might encounter. This would be a third vehicle for us which would only be used for offroading. Here is the Jeep in particular I am looking at : http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/exterior.jpg http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/Front.jpg http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/suspension.jpg http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/discos or not.jpg The dealer doesn't know too much about it, He said it has a 5\" susp. lift, 1\" body lift (the blocks looked like a 2\" to me), automatic locker in the rear (doesn't know what brand), 488 gears, 35\" Mickey Thompson Baja Claws on Cobra Mustang wheels , and custom front and rear bumpers with integrated hitch (don't know what brand). Its a 4 banger BTW. I test drove it briefly, and with the wheel at full turn the tires rub a lot, not sure on what though; bumper or fender well. Does this mean that on full compression they would also have major rubbing? I have no way of testing that out. One more thing, I have never driven a truck that had Death Wobble but I'm pretty sure this one did, around 35-40. The dealer said the toe in was screwed up and they would fix it, but it concerns me. Also I noticed no steering stabilizer, which I'm sure would help a bit. Anyway, I would plan on having a mechanic look at it, checking the ball joints and so on. It seems like a nicely built truck for a really good price, but I'm nervous. I couldn't afford to build my own for this amount, thats for sure. I'm not about to go out and buy it without researching it though, so any advice you can give would be great. Also, from what you know and the pictures I have what price range would you give it (107K miles). If anyone lives in the twin cities area that feels like helping a jeep rookie out, that would be awesome too. I get the feeling that I should probably wait it out and get something I know a little more about though.</th>\n",

       "      <th>I just wanted to throw my 2 cents in here. I just bought my 1994 Jeep Wrangler. I went through the same things. It is my first jeep and I have had it for about a month now. I love it. I have the 4.0 liter in mine and wanted to get a 4.0 because they have more power. Personal preference on my part. With the 4.88 gears in this one, you should be just fine with the 4cyl. Here is what I had everyone tell me when I looked at mine. If is has the stock Dana 35 in it, make sure and get it checked. The tubes bend easily if it has been 4-wheeled hard. Make sure they are straight or you will spend a ton fixing axles and bearings all the time. Make sure the lift is straight and that the front end is lined up with that high a lift on it. Check the tie rods on it to make sure there is not any bending, especially with 35's on it. I have about the same lift and I have 33's and that is plenty and nothing rubs. I was told with 35's you risk breaking stock axles. Just too much tire for stock axles. As far as price, I am in Colorado and will tell you Jeep YJ's like what I saw in your pictures and with that mileage and options usually will sell for anywhere from $8000 up to $13,000. Just do yourself a favor and run it by a trusted 4x4 shop. I paid $200 for my inspection and it was worth every penny. The guy told me one axle problem and you are dropping $1000 or more into it right away. Also, shop around. The first Jeep I looked at sounded like a great deal but I passed on it. Two weeks later I found the one I wanted with better options and it was $900 less. My last piece of advice is make sure you get what you want the first time. I can't tell you how many friends have sunk a ton of money into their Jeeps upgrading something. ( i.e. 4cyl to 4.0 or Dans 35 axles to Dana 44's , etc. ) Good luck!</th>\n",

       "      <th>I don't know what it's worth. But, if it's your first jeep, I'd probably look for something that is much more stock. From the pictures I can tell it has extended shackles (good for bending springs, I've done it) and possibly a full length add-a-leaf. This combination should give somewhere around 4 inches of lift. The body lift is at least a 2\", I've seen plenty of those. Basically, the lift combination is the cheapest, least technical way to lift a jeep. (read: probably rides rougher than usual, and handles like crap) Those tires are expensive, but the wheels are an odd choice. I don't know the backspacing, but I'm sure it's not enough. They could be using spacers, but that isn't much better. Those will put additional strain on the axles and cause them to break more often. From the factory YJs (87-95 Wranglers) have a Dana 35 rear and Dana 30 front axle. They are not really very strong, especially when mated to 35s and a locker. If you drive it again, or noticed before, cheap automatic lockers will click when coasting around tight corners. It's pretty loud, so you should hear it at low speeds. This isn't a bad thing, many people use them (usually Lock Right brand by PowerTrax) and so do I. They create funny handling characteristics on the street. The jeep will pull one direction then the next when on the gas. The 4.88 gears are great for off-roading, especially with 35s. But, they will increase the power transferred to the axles, which will probably break them more often. My recommendation is to look for a jeep in near stock form. If it has larger than 31s on it, there most likely have been fairly extensive mods performed. In my opinion, if you're new to off-roading you should start our slow (read: stock or close to it) and grow as your experience level grows. It is probably more rewarding, and safer.

Its a 4 speed auto and its accually pretty strong. I have heard of people converting to that tranny. its allot better. has a locking torch converter on it that is acccually programable. so you can set it to lock up for the most part. what that means is the auto tranny won't disengadge going down hills as much. It will stay in gear. allot better gear ratio in the tranny for both on and off road performance. I really wanted to put one in my jeep but the convertion for ford to gm tanny was more then i wanted to spend at the time, Still planning on it though. You will want to change out at least your back axle. cuz your going to break it with a v8. i broke mine liek 2 times. Changed over to a ford 8.8 axle off of a ford explorer. the best year of axle is 95 and newer. They come with disc brakes. the 8.8 is allot stronger then the dana 44 axles. You can go to http://mountainoffroad.com and they have some info on the convertion and a kit for it to. as far as radiator goes the stock yj radiator will work fine. but if you want a really good radiator you can go to http://zandm.com and they have a really good radiator there and some other jeep parts that they make. for the exhaust i would just go with shorty headers and then have a muffler shop run the exhaust out the sides under the frame right behind or in frount of where the leaf springs connect to the frame. they fix there pretty well and then run glass packs down the side and out in frount of the back tires. Thats how i have them on my jeep i will get some pics and post them on my jeep page if you want. just email me if you have any other questions.</th>\n",

       "      <th>I started having trouble turning my key to start the jeep, then it wouldn't turn all the way back to the lock position..so I took the steering wheel off to access the switch and stuff. I found a spring had worked it's way into the gears on the switch assembly. Does anyone know what those springs are for? Now I'm trying to put it back together minus the springs, but am having trouble figuring out where some rod goes. I think it's the high/low beam actuater rod, but it feels really loose..so I'm thinking it may have became disconnected at the other end. Anyone had the steering column apart..any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm almost ready to take it to the dealer and let them put the pieces back together. Thanks, Charlie</th>\n",

       "      <th>Let me start off by saying I have never owned Jeep and know very little about them or any solid axle truck for that matter. I am looking at getting a modified used '95 YJ and I'm looking for your advice and opinions, potential problems I might encounter. This would be a third vehicle for us which would only be used for offroading. Here is the Jeep in particular I am looking at : http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/exterior.jpg http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/Front.jpg http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/suspension.jpg http://home.sprintmail.com/~tcdesign/discos or not.jpg The dealer doesn't know too much about it, He said it has a 5\" susp. lift, 1\" body lift (the blocks looked like a 2\" to me), automatic locker in the rear (doesn't know what brand), 488 gears, 35\" Mickey Thompson Baja Claws on Cobra Mustang wheels , and custom front and rear bumpers with integrated hitch (don't know what brand). Its a 4 banger BTW. I test drove it briefly, and with the wheel at full turn the tires rub a lot, not sure on what though; bumper or fender well. Does this mean that on full compression they would also have major rubbing? I have no way of testing that out. One more thing, I have never driven a truck that had Death Wobble but I'm pretty sure this one did, around 35-40. The dealer said the toe in was screwed up and they would fix it, but it concerns me. Also I noticed no steering stabilizer, which I'm sure would help a bit. Anyway, I would plan on having a mechanic look at it, checking the ball joints and so on. It seems like a nicely built truck for a really good price, but I'm nervous. I couldn't afford to build my own for this amount, thats for sure. I'm not about to go out and buy it without researching it though, so any advice you can give would be great. Also, from what you know and the pictures I have what price range would you give it (107K miles). If anyone lives in the twin cities area that feels like helping a jeep rookie out, that would be awesome too. I get the feeling that I should probably wait it out and get something I know a little more about though.</th>\n",
